<h1 id="intro">Developing apps for QuickSchools</h1>
<p>Any developer can develop apps for QuickSchools. We provide a framework and tools for you to quickly build apps.

The look and feel of your apps will generally mirror those of the built-in QuickSchools modules.
  
Your apps can extend QuickSchools in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add menus with your own code running under each menu, displaying content exactly as you specify.</li>
    <li>Hook into various "insertion points" within the QuickSchools application so that you can extend our existing functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Generally, the steps for creating an App is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sign up for a trial QuickSchools account. This is free for 30 days.</li>
    <li>Get familiar with turning on and off different features, and configuring those features.</li>
    <li>Under the Features menu, turn on the App Development option.</li>
    <li>You'll see a new App Developer Console menu.</li>
    <li>Create an App.</li>
    <li>Configure the menus that it will have.</li>
    <li>Create the configuration screen that users will see when they turn on the app.</li>
    <li>Start writing JavaScript to programmatically render screens.</li>
    <li>Develop components which are made of HTML, CSS and JS when necessary. Instantiate these components from your JavaScript.</li>
    <li>When you're ready, submit the application for approval.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pre-requisites">Requirements Checklist</h2>
