<h1 id="intro">REST API Overview</h1>
<p>The QuickSchools REST API allows you to query data from QuickSchools. You can also use it to make changes to your QuickSchools data.
</p>

<h2 id="api-endpoint">API Endpoint</h2>
<p>All API calls are made to the following base URL.</p>
<blockquote>https://api.quickschools.com/sms/v1</blockquote>

<h2 id="authentication-intro">Authentication</h1>
<p>API method calls require authentication.
    
There are three ways to authenticate an API call, depending on where you are calling the REST API from.

<b>Method 1: Making API calls from QuickSchools Apps</b>
If you are building native apps using the QuickSchools App Developer Console, then calls to the REST API methods are authenticated with the currently logged-in user using your app. You do not need an API key, and should not use one even if you have one. If your app mistakenly tries to access data that the user is not authenticated for, your API call will return with 401 Unauthorized. <a target="_blank" href="http://dev.quickschools.com"><i>(Here is the documentation on building native QuickSchools apps).</i></a>

<b>Method 2: Making API calls from an external application</b>
If you are calling the REST API from an external application, such as from your school web server, then you'll need an <a href="#api-keys">API key</a> to send as the "apiKey" parameter with every API call. Be sure to keep the API key secure and never insert API keys in javascript.

<b>Method 3: Making API calls after OAuth authorization</b>
The <a href="#oauth">OAuth authorization</a> flow will give you an access token. This can be used as the API key.
</p>

<h2 id="authorization-intro">Authorization</h2>
<p>Each logged-in user is only able to access data for which the user is authorized for. For example, a parent cannot access the grades of a student for which he is not responsible for, and a student can't change her own grade. Apps calling the REST API from within QuickSchools will be subject to these restrictions, depending on the logged-in user. These restrictions are noted for each API method.</p>

<p>Calls using API keys, however, have no such restrictions. They are able to access and change any data. You should keep API keys  securely for this reason. For example, they should never be used in javascript or shared with students.</p>
